# About swyxkit!

This is swyx's preferred starter for Svelte projects:

- SvelteKit
- Tailwind 3 + Tailwind Typography
- Netlify
- GitHub Issues as CMS

Feel free to rip out these opinions as you see fit of course.

## Live Demo

See https://swyxkit.netlify.app/

## Key Features and Design Considerations:

- Features
  - Dark mode
  - Github-issues-driven Blog with blog index
    - Blog content pulled from the GitHub Issues API - make to set your `GH_USER_REPO` variable!
    - Comment and Reaction system from Github Issues
    - Consumes markdown/MDSveX
      - with syntax highlighting
  - RSS (at `/rss.xml`) with caching
- Performance touches
  - no `hydrate` on about and blog pages
    - *update: temporarily disabled while we figure out mobile nav without hydration*
  - set `maxage` to 1 minute to cache (consider making it 1-7 days on older posts)
    - for API endpoints as well as pages
  - Security headers in `netlify.toml`
    - [X-Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options)
    - [X-Frame-Options](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options)
    - [X-XSS-Protection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-XSS-Protection)
    - SvelteKit does not yet support [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) - [PR pending here](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/pull/2394/files)
  - [Builds and Deploys in ~40 seconds on Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/sites/swyxkit/deploys)
- Minor design/UX touches
  - Top level blog URLs (`/myblog` instead of `/blog/myblog` - sliiightly better SEO/url design)
  - Blog index truncates at 20 posts to make sure to render quickly
  - [Comments are rendered and sanitized](https://github.com/developit/snarkdown/issues/70)
  - Error page (try going to URL that doesnt exist)
    - including nice error when github api rate limit exceeded
  - Navlink hover effect
  - [Mobile/Responsive styling](https://swyxkit.netlify.app/mobileresponsive-styling-with-tailwind)
  - Mobile menu with animation
  - Og:image and meta tags for social unfurls (not automatically generated though)
  - Accessibility
    - SVG Icons https://github.com/sw-yx/spark-joy/blob/master/README.md#general--misc
    - [Tap targets](https://web.dev/tap-targets/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr)
  - Custom scrollbar https://css-tricks.com/strut-your-stuff-with-a-custom-scrollbar/
  - Defensive CSS touches https://ishadeed.com/article/defensive-css

> ⚠️ known issue - syntax highlighting of mdsvex currently adds extra `@html` for no reason. [We use a workaround](https://github.com/pngwn/MDsveX/issues/392)

## Setup

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/sw-yx/swyxkit
export GH_TOKEN=your_gh_token_here # can skip if just trying out this repo casually
npm install
npm run start
```

You should be able to deploy this project straight to Netlify as is, just [like this project is](https://app.netlify.com/sites/swyxkit/deploys/).

Before deploying, remember to configure `/lib/siteConfig.js` - just some hardcoded vars i want you to remember to configure.

This blog uses GitHub as a CMS - if you are doing any serious development at all, you should give `process.env.GH_TOKEN` to raise rate limit from 60 to 5000. Just make a really basic personal access token, should be enough.
https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting

When deploying, don't forget to set it in Netlify: https://app.netlify.com/sites/YOUR_SITE/settings/deploys#environment
